## Help Wanted
- Firefox/Safari/Edge port

## Things I am aware of:

- Text replacement is aggressive and does not discriminate on what domains it runs on
- More than just the term "millennials" gets replaced
- There is a lack of a glossary. This is intended.
- I'll sometimes allow new terms, but not on any given schedule or via any published criteria
- There is no indication that the extension is running other than text has been replaced
- There is no count of how many words have been changed, either on a given page or historically
- The hypothesis of linguistic determinism is now generally agreed to be false
- Come at me, bloodmouths
